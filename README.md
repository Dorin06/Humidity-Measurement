# Humidity Measurement Using DHT Sensor

This repository contains the code for a **Humidity Measurement** project utilizing a DHT sensor as part of an embedded systems task. The project focuses on measuring ambient humidity levels and displaying the readings on a serial monitor or LCD.

## Project Overview

In this project, a DHT sensor (such as DHT11 or DHT22) is employed to gauge the surrounding humidity. The sensor is connected to a microcontroller, which reads the data and processes it for display. This project provides foundational knowledge of sensor interfacing, data acquisition, and output display in embedded systems.

### Components Used:
- **DHT Sensor:** DHT11 or DHT22
- **Microcontroller:** Arduino, ESP32, or similar
- **Breadboard**
- **Jumper Wires**
- **Optional:** LCD Display for visual output

### Features:
- Real-time humidity measurement.
- Simple setup with digital sensor interfacing.
- Display of humidity data on the serial monitor or LCD.
- Potential for temperature measurement integration.

### How to Use:
1. **Connections:** Connect the DHT sensor to the microcontroller, ensuring proper wiring for VCC, GND, and the data pin.
2. **Upload Code:** Use the appropriate IDE (e.g., Arduino IDE) to upload the project code to the microcontroller.
3. **View Readings:** Open the Serial Monitor or check the LCD to see the humidity readings in real time.

### Future Improvements:
- Integrate temperature measurement capabilities.
- Implement data logging for historical analysis.
- Enable wireless data transmission to a server or mobile application.
