In embedded systems, humidity measurement can be achieved using sensors like DHT11 or DHT22 connected to an Arduino Uno. These sensors detect moisture in the air and provide both humidity and temperature data. The sensor is connected to the Arduino, which processes the data and outputs the humidity level through the serial monitor. This setup is commonly used in applications like weather monitoring, HVAC systems, and greenhouse control, offering real-time, accurate humidity readings.
